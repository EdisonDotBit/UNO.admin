Creating a student database and table is a fundamental aspect of managing student information in educational institutions. This system allows educational institutions to organize and store data about their students efficiently. In this example, we'll design a simple student database with a table that includes the following details for each student: Student No., Name, Birthday, Course, and Email. Additionally, we'll outline a basic login design for users to access and manage this database.

Features:
- Registration
- Login
- Create Database function (allows users to input table, columns, and rows)
- Search Function, allows to filter and search althrought the create database table.

**The system is inspired and works the same as PHPMYADMIN**

Tech-Stack:
- PHP
- MySQL
- HTML
- CSS
